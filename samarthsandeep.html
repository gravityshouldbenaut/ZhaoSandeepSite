          <h4> Where is automotive design headed? </h4>
  		
          <h6 > <b>May 26th, 2015</b></h6>
          <p>
            The automobile has been with us for about 150 years now. But in that time, their design has drastically changed every 10 years or so. As a whole, cars have become smaller, yet include more equipment and more spacious interiors. They are also closely resembling the latest trends in design more than they had been before. Where have we come from to get to this place in automotive history? And what does the future design of the automobile look like?
        <br></br>
          <b>The Beginning(late 1800s to the mid 1900s)</b><br>
          <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/relayto/image/upload/w_737,q_95//images_originals/555699d9b798e.jpeg"><br>
          The first cars all had a similar design. A large radiator adorned the front, in between two large, circular yellow headlights. The wheels were slightly larger than those on a bicycle, and were connected by two axles, a visible one in the front, and one hidden under the  wheel arches at the back. The seating arrangements were much like those on a stagecoach. In fact, if you really look at the car as a whole, it looks like a stagecoach with an engine and steering wheel in the place of the horse and its reins. Even with such a lackluster design, these cars, particularly this one, the Ford Model T, became extremely popular. However, with its popularity, people were looking for better features and more comfort. <br>
          <br></br>
          <b>The Glorious 50s, 60s, and 70s</b><br>
          <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/relayto/image/upload/w_737,q_95//images_originals/5556a155a26d6.jpeg"><br>
          The 50s saw the rise of rock and roll, and to a lesser extent, hip hop. It also saw the rise of thought-out automotive design. This was the time when the sports car and the sedan gained huge traction. This was also the time when Lamborghini created the Miura, the world's first supercar. If we look at the exterior, the cars of this era were more colorful and more playful in their use of shapes. Cars were evolving from being just boxes for the use of transportation to objects we could admire, with a new curve here and a little orange paint there. The headlights were still, for the most part, circular, but the additions of svelte curves made each car's headlights look unique to that design. The interior of the car changed dramatically as well. The automobile now became a place you could sit for more than just an hour, with amenities such as a stereo, cupholders, and larger,more comfortable seats.             <br>
        <br></br>
          <b>Let's be square for two decades(1980-2000)</b><br>
          <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/relayto/image/upload/w_737,q_95//images_originals/5556a3d01df5c.jpeg"><br>
          With the big oil crisis in the 70s, and gradual shift from analogue to digital taking place, the cars of the 80s and 90s can be described as being built more for practicality and stability than for anything else. The rise of a new type of car was seen in this era: the hatchback. The hatchback made it possible for a person to have a car that was as fun to drive as a sedan, but had greater practicality, with the rear hatch allowing for greater room in the back. Some design cues easily spotted from this era is the use of square headlights, square dashboards, and dials with minimalist digital readouts. For some reason, car companies at this time really liked to use squares for lights on the exterior. Take this Peugeot 205, which was created to appeal to younger generations. It has square front headlights, square rear braking lights, and rectangular lines for a radiator. On the inside, there are square dials, with very unoriginal uppercase white lettering for the readout on each dial. Even the Ferrari's of the time used square headlights and a square dashboard. To me, a new trend in the automotive world started to catch on: the mirroring of software design trends. At around this time, Apple had released its Lisa, which was square, and used a very similar font to the one used in dashboard readouts. Coincidence? I think not.
          <br></br>
          <b>The MySpace-OS X Tiger Era(2000-2010)</b><br>
          <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/relayto/image/upload/w_737,q_95//images_originals/5556a738041cb.jpeg"><br>
          At the dawn of the 3rd millennium, automotive design shifted once more. The once square headlights started to round out. A lot of the curves previously seen in the 50s, 60s, and 70s began to come back. This especially came about with a greater interest towards safety and economy, and a more aerodynamic car can act better during a collision and use less fuel. The interior of the car changed as well. The central console began to turn into one controlled by screens rather than by knobs and dials, and included much more equipment, such as connection with your mobile phone and the ability to read more music formats, such as CDs, flash drives, and even from your MP3 player. The trend of cars and software sharing a similar design continued. Myspace used circular icons as profile photos, and Facebook originally used a combination of squares and circles for links, and the photos for pages and profiles. Apple's Mac OS X Tiger also made use of the circular design as icons for applications on the dock, which holds your favorite programs. The list goes on.
          <br></br>
          <b>The present(2010+)</b><br>
          <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/relayto/image/upload/w_737,q_95//images_originals/5556aa726bbf6.jpeg"><br>
          Design after 2010 became much more crisp and functional in the automotive world. Unlike the previously used square-like circles and curves, the exterior of recent cars have sharp curves and bold lines. This Jaguar F Type uses these bold lines to make the rear lights look crisp and refreshing. The same trend can also be seen in the interiors.
For example, many of the latest steering wheels have a flat bottom and a circular top, and dashboards are now consisting of a large central dial with a computer readout, and two square like dials on either side. The main feature in the central console in these cars is a screen. Or in the case of some of the more high end brands, there can sometimes not even be a central screen, with just a few buttons taking its place, and all information receivable only through the dashboard. This minimalism is making cars smaller on the outside, but roomier on the inside, with the latest hatchbacks and sedans having much greater rear leg room and trunk space than ever before. Software has also been trending towards sharper, bolder lines and curves, as well as a greater interest in minimalism. The Yo app, for example, sends the message Yo to another user if they tap on their name. How simple is that? The latest YouTube app uses bold, crisp lines to separate a the comment section from the suggested videos, as well as for the icons used to play, pause, and connect to Chromecast. Just like the sharper lines and minimalism allows for greater rear legroom and more trunk space in the latest Toyota Corolla, it allows for more space to display actual content from videos in the app.
          <br></br>
          <b>The Future</b><br>
          <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/relayto/image/upload/w_737,q_95//images_originals/5556aec952c00.jpeg"><br>
          If we look at how cars have evolved, the future of automotive design seems to be towards even simpler design, and even more practicality. This Infiniti QX30 concept has sharp lines everywhere, even on the seats. This allows for more room, better fuel economy, due to better aerodynamics, and just, in general, a better look. If you look at what cars Infiniti had made until this concept came out, you would not imagine that such a company could make something so beautiful. I think this trend of more simple designs is going to stick with us for a while, especially as much of software is heading in that direction as well. Google's latest design language, material design, includes many of the aspects of design seen in concept cars, with its bold lines, clear partitions, layered buttons, and minimalist approach. All in all, we live in an automotive renaissance right now, and the future seems as if it will add on to this. With beautiful cars that you can be for under $20,000, automotive design is at its absolute best, and can only get better.
